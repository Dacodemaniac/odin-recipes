    <h3>Egusi soup with stock fish and every jollification</h3>
    <p>
      The Nigerian Egusi soup, prepared with melon seeds, is prepared by most
      tribes in Nigeria in many different ways. It is known as Miyan Gushi in
      Hausa, Ofe Egusi in Igbo and Efo Elegusi in Yoruba.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4Â½ cups (600g) Egusi (Melon) seeds</li>
      <li>2 cooking spoons red palm oil</li>
      <li>Best cut and Shaki (cow tripe)</li>
      <li>Fish: Dry Fish and Stock Fish</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons ground crayfish</li>
      <li>Pepper and Salt (to taste)</li>
      <li>Vegetable: Nigerian pumpkin leaves, spinach or bitter leaves</li>
      <li>3 small stock cubes</li>
      <li>1 Ogiri Okpei (traditional locust bean seasoning: optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil the shaki, stock fish and dry fish in 1 litre of water with the
        stock cubes till they are well done. First sign of a done shaki is that
        the cuts will start curling on itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil,season and grill your chicken or chevonWash the beef to be used for
        the soup, add it to the pot and cook on medium heat till done
      </li>
      <li>
        As soon as the shaki, fish and meat are done, add crayfish and pepper,
        stir and remove all the meat from the stock (water used in cooking the
        meat and fish) and place in a different pot or plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ground egusi to the stock and stir. If the stock from cooking
        your meat and fish is not enough to give you a medium consistency, add
        some water to get the consistency of evaporated milk or a bit thicker.
        It will not be as smooth as evaporated milk though
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook till the egusi cakes. Stir and add a little bit more
        water, watch it closely so that it does not burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the red palm oil and bitter leaves (if it is your choice of
        vegetable), pepper and salt to taste and cook for about 7 minutes. You
        know it is good to continue when the palm oil and egusi forms a good
        blend of light yellow colour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt to your taste, stir and leave to simmer for 2 minutes maximum.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat. Leave to stand for about 5 minutes before serving
      </li>
    </ol>
